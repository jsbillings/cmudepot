As of this release, depot currently works and has been used
on the following systems:
	
	IBM RT AOS 4.3
	SunOS 4.1.1 with AFS 3.1 support
	Ultrix 4.2a/RISC with AFS 3.1 support

The following systems should compile:
	IBM RS6000/AIX 3.1 with AFS 3.1 support
	HP9000/720 HP/UX 8.0

SYSV systems may need to define USE_UTIME so utime(3) is used instead of 
utimes(2). This is currently required for the RS6000 and the HP. 
There may be some problems with the HPs and RS6000s. These will be addressed
in future releases.

AFS sites should define USE_FSINFO. Sites without AFS should comment out the 
lines starting with AFSLIBS, AFSCFLAGS, AFSOBJ. AFS is NOT required for
depot to run. However, we have only really used depot in an AFS environment.

Sites without build should examine Makefile.dist and comment
out/uncomment the appropriate sections. Sites with build can just do a
build -f Makefile.build. build probably only exists at CMU so if you don't
have build, it is no big deal.

Malloc.c is provided for AFS sites in which the ITC malloc has snuck
in. The ITC malloc is probably both buggy and slow, especially on
newer system types. The ITC malloc should not be present in version of
AFS after 3.2.

Questions about depot may be sent to depot+@andrew.cmu.edu. If you pick up
a copy of depot, please drop a note to that address just so we have an idea
of how many people are using it.
