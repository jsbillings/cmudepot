Various minor bug fixes
Speed enchancements
target link, target copy, target noop options
Exits if can't write the lock file with a meaningful error message
copies files to .NEW and then renames them if the copy succeeds (checks both
write errors and errors on close)

Fewer AFS touches - 

~command is run if the collection updates rather than if the target updates, 
	IF the target is trusted (ie needs a -Q)

ignore,override and specialfile are now cumulative (ie 
	ignore: foo
	ignore: bar
in the custom.depot will result in foo and bar being ignored)

patchlevel.h foo. about ready to go to CSR
removed imakefile from distribution
